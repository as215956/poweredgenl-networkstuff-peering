If youre connected at the Frys IX and/or SPeed IX im able to peer with you if you'd like.

## Procedure

Very easy: make a pull request for the peers.yaml file, and i will approve it. A cron script is running every few hours to pick up the yaml file and the bgp configuration will be automatically generated at my router.
