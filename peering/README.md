# Peering with AS200132

If youre connected at the Frys-IX and/or Speed-IX or other IX's im able to peer with you if you'd like. All my information is stored on peeringdb: https://www.peeringdb.com/net/32117 and is updated as soon as changes take place.

## Procedure

Very easy: make a pull request for the peers.yaml file, and i will approve it. I will then run the scripting to pick up the yaml file and the bgp configuration will be automatically generated at my router.
